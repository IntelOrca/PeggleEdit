# 1. Operating Systems #
You must have an operating system that supports .NET Framework 3.5 e.g. Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7. The latest source targets .NET framework 4.7+ under Windows 7 onwards.

# 2. Downloading and Compiling #

There are three ways to obtain a copy of PeggleEdit:
  1. A **ready-to-use executable** (compiled binary) in an archive for the latest stable release can be downloaded from the [download page](https://github.com/IntelOrca/PeggleEdit/releases).
  1. The **source code** of the latest stable release can be downloaded as an archive from the [download page](https://github.com/IntelOrca/PeggleEdit/releases).
  1. The very latest development source code can be <a href='https://github.com/IntelOrca/PeggleEdit'>cloned from <b>GitHub</b></a>.

If you've gone with option 2 or 3, then you will now need to compile PeggleEdit. The solution should be readable by Visual Studio 2010 or C# Express Edition 2010. OpenSource equivalents should also work such as SharpDevelop.

# 3. Go Create! #

If you are now at the stage where you have an executable build of PeggleEdit and all the required run-time libraries then you should be able to run PeggleEdit.

If you have any questions then take a look at the [FAQ](FrequentlyAskedQuestions.md) or e-mail one of the project owners / contributors.
