# Help / Tutorials #
For a fully functional editor, the tools needed to create levels are meant to be simple but may not always be obvious. Of course although making basic levels may be easy, making complicated levels isn't. Therefore a collection of help pages, tutorials and videos is needed to aid beginners in using the editor and level making. Anyone that can assist would be grateful.

# Showcasing #
Peggle was released in 2007, Peggle Nights was released late in the following year. This means a lot of people will have moved on from Peggle and perhaps playing more recent games such as Plants vs Zombies or Bejeweled 3. It may be just a case of letting them know about the editor and the new user created levels that bring them back and play them and create their own. Getting the word out can be as easy as uploading videos of the editor in use or your levels being played on YouTube. As well as any other ways you can think of.

# Development #
At the moment it has been a one man project to get PeggleEdit to version 0.4 after hours and hours of coding, reverse engineering and designing to work out the format for levels and build a fully functional / easy to use editor. Now that the hard part is over, anyone is welcome to submit changes or become a developer to help speed up the rest of the development.
