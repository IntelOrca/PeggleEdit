Teleports are objects which move the ball to another part of the level or remove it completely to end the go.

## Appearance ##
If teleports are visible, they will be displayed as a white box. Normally you will want to make the teleport invisible and place a foreground image over the top using a polygon or circle. PopCap's levels typically place a polygon showing an image of a vortex which rotates.
